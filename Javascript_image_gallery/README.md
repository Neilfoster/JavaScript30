# Flex Panels
---

The focus of the challenge was implementing flex characteristics on a gallery of photos (in panel format). In addition to adding the flex properties to the panels in CSS, event listeners were added to the JS code to add the appropriate toggle open and active classes (which cue transitions) when the panels are clicked on.

### Design 

This page uses images and flexbox panels to display various images. 

### Features

The main feature of this application is to display a gallery of images, which expand and
retract when clicking on. It also hides and displayes text when clicked.

images and text when clicked on.
